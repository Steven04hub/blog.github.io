## 3.1
```sql

<br>

## 3.22
```sql

```
<br>

## 3.23
```sql

   from (select dept_name,sum(salary) value from instructor group by dept_name) dept_total,
   (select avg(value) value from dept_total) dept_total_avg

<br>

## 3.24

```sql

   from student,advisor,instructor 
   where student.ID=advisor.s_id and instructor.ID=advisor.i_id
   and student.dept_name='Accounting' and instructor.dept_name='Physics'
```
<br>

## 3.25
```sql
   select a.dept_name from department a, department b
   where a.budget>b.budget and b.dept_name='Philosophy'
   order by a.dept_name asc
```
<br>

## 3.26
```sql
   select course_id,ID from takes
   group by ID,course_id
   having count(*)>2
   order by course_id
```
<br>

## 3.27
```sql
   with a as
   (select course_id,ID from takes
   group by ID,course_id
   having count(*)>1
   order by course_id)
   select ID from a
   group by ID having count(*)>2
```
<br>

## 3.28
```sql
   select distinct a.ID, a.name from instructor a,teaches b,course c
   where b.ID=a.ID and c.course_id=b.course_id 
   and a.dept_name=c.dept_name
   order by a.name   
```
<br>

## 3.29
```sql
   with a as (select ID 
   from takes natural join course where dept_name='Music'
   group by ID having count(*)<5) 
   select name,ID from student 
   where name like 'D%' and dept_name='History' and ID in(select * from a)
```

## 3.30
&emsp;&emsp;当某些元组的salary为空值时，avg函数在计算时会忽略控制，但是count(*)计算的行数，不会忽略空值。例子如下<br>
|salary|
|:----:|
|10000|
|null|

avg(salary)的计算结果时10000，null被忽略；sum(salary)的计算结果是10000,count(*)计算的结果是2，最终结果是5000。

<br>

## 3.31
```sql

   select ID,name 
   from instructor a  
   where not exists
   (select * from teaches b,takes c 
   where a.ID=b.ID and b.course_id=c.course_id
   and b.sec_id=c.sec_id and b.semester=c.semester 
   and b.year=c.year and c.grade='A')

```
<br>

## 3.32
```sql
   select ID,name 
   from instructor a  
   where not exists
   (select * from teaches b,takes c 
   where a.ID=b.ID and b.course_id=c.course_id
   and b.sec_id=c.sec_id and b.semester=c.semester 
   and b.year=c.year and c.grade='A') 
   minus
   select ID,name from instructor 
   where not exists
   (select * from takes join teaches using(course_id,sec_id,semester,year) 
   where instructor.ID=teaches.ID and grade is not null)
```
<br>

## 3.33
```sql
   select course_id,title from course a where dept_name='Comp. Sci.'
   and exists (select * from section natural join time_slot 
   where  a.course_id=course_id and end_hr>=12)
```
<br>

## 3.34
```sql
   select course_id,sec_id,year,semester,count(*) num 
   from takes
   group by course_id,sec_id,year,semester
   having count(*)>0
```
<br>

## 3.35
```sql
   with a
   as 
   (select course_id,sec_id,year,semester,count(*) num 
   from takes
   group by course_id,sec_id,year,semester
   having count(*)>0)
   select * from a where num=(select max(num) from a)
